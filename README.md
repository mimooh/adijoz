Vacation/leave planner. You can define a set of leave types, like holiday,
sickness etc. Each employ can pick their leave days by clicking in a calendar.
Particularly suited for Polish Fireservice.

I want to keep it small/easy/readable, so it will probably be a frontend only
and you will need to integrate it with a DB backend.
